# PLEIO 
- Pleiotropic Locus Exploration and Interpretation using Optimal test

`pleio` is a command line tool for performinig meta-analysis of multiple GWAS summary statistics. 

## Getting Started

In order to download `pleio`, you should clone this repository via the command
```
git clone https://github.com/cuelee/pleio.git
cd pleio
```

In order to run `pleio`, the following python dependencies must be installed in your system.
